# TO TEACHER:
Dear Mr. Bonneville,

  Hello >:D
  
  This is the code used to create my colored pixel art drawing, but it works for any image thats under 255x255. I wanted to make a hyper quality image, but as it turns out the code.org's websites max quality is 255(sad). ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67450938/186827499-184415fb-60a2-4156-8055-844555224df1.png) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67450938/187013944-f0ce2877-586e-48d8-8bae-6c08e626a84c.png)![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67450938/187014149-b0940b7d-68eb-4fac-b680-4f5c1a4c1c40.png)

 These images are proof that this did work and I didn't just save some online image. I believe this still counts as doing the project, because others are also copying online images, however they are working harder, not smarter(however i do think what I've done is harder than making a deformed mario). 

Thank you for your time,

Kingston Du :D
